This project was made in my free time.

Therefore, in some places there is repetition of code and complication.

I also added an AI simulation, but in fact it's just a random move selection.

This project was actually started to practice with the hook use Reducer()

Don't judge strictly, the project was made only on the basis of the knowledge that I knew at the moment (without looking at any other solutions)
